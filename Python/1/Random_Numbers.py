#What do the following functions do?
#random - generates ramdom float between 0-1  
#uniform - generates random float between two numbers
#randint - generates ramdom integer between two numbers

#Import random here:
from random import uniform, randint
#Print a random Float between 0.0 & 1.0
print(uniform(0,1))
#Print a random interger between 1 & 10
print(randint(1,10))
#Print a random Float between 10 & 71
print(uniform(10,71))
#Print a random interger between 24 & 98
print(randint(24,98))
